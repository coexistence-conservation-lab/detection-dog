Wildlife tracking technologies are increasingly used to study animal behaviour, inform conservation and management, and help answer fundamental questions in ecology. However, a drawback to wildlife telemetry is that equipment is expensive and can be difficult to retrieve if lost in the field, leading to loss of data and inefficient use of project resources. As a potential solution, we began training dogs to search for and locate GPS tracking devices by scent. Here, we report on the training, deployment and evaluation of one wildlife telemetry detection dog. The detection dog successfully recovered ~$11,200 AUD worth of lost GPS devices over a 16-month period. Following this, we conducted a controlled field evaluation to assess detection dog performance compared with human-only searches. The detection dog located 100% of targets compared to 43% by the human-only search. The detection dog was significantly faster, with an average search time of 6.4 minutes (±1.5 SE, n = 17) compared to 43.9  minutes (±4.9 SE, n = 14) for human-only searches, indicating that the detection dog was sixteen times more efficient. This is the first time the use of conservation dogs to detect wildlife telemetry devices has been reported in the literature. This novel method   contributes to the expanding use of detection dogs for diverse conservation applications.
